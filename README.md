# Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion App
purpose: This Windows Store App opens with a Splash Screen and allows a user to convert a Fahrenheit temperature, and the 
equivalent Celsius temperature should be displayed. 

I create this Windows Store App using a Windows 8 Computer with Visual Studio 2012 and the Visual Basic Language 
and XAML, pronounced Zamel. XAML (Extensive Application Markup Language). is a markup language that simplifies the 
layout of a user interface for a .NET Framework Application. So i used Visual Basic to code the events and XAML
to design the user interface for the Windows Store app.
